Time went by quickly and Nancy was four years old then.
She could do many things by herself and she was quite a well-behaved girl at that age.
Everyday, she would went to field with her grandmother. When there was a hot burning sun in the sky, she would take a big black shabby umbrella with her.
When rainy days came, she always put on a straw rain cape which was said to be made by grandfather long long ago.
Every time when grandmother was turning over the soil, Nancy would pull the weeds from the land.
Though she was much too young, she completely understood how arduous her grandmother was.
Consequently, she was always ready to try her best to help grandmother.
Life might be not easy for them, but warm and sweet enough to bring them happiness.
